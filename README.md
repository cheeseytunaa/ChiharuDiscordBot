Just an epic story about progress of creating the bot
-----------------------------------------------------
I started coding the project on 02/11/2021 (31rd of December in Lunar Calendar | Lunar New Year's Eve). Chaochao-chan and I were coding the bot together, and we celebrated the New Year together.

FEATURES
--------
- Commands:
  - `saveprofile` : Create a templete of Empty profile. Also save your DiscordID in our data file. (./data/profile.json)
  - `deleteprofile` ⚠ : Delete your existing profile.
  - `configprofile` : Edit your properties on your profile.
  - `resetproperty` : This is the same as when you empty the properties while using `configprofile`, but this command is used for some properties that have the type is List or Tuple.
  - `profile` : Display your profile in an embed message.
- Configurations for the bot: (./data/config.json)
  - `token` : Change the token for the bot. (You can even create a bot for yourself)
  - `prefix` : Customize the prefix of the bot.
- Customize your profile by yourself: Don't want to use command? Just go to `./data/config.json` and write some data.
  - Firstly, create your profile by typing the command `saveprofile`.
  - Then, go to the profile file and edit.

*Empty profile (without customized-properties):

By the way, the age property will be automatically calculated when you insert the year of date of birth! (If you haven't passed your birthday in the current year, the age will be deducted by 1)

SETUP AND CUSTOMIZATION - BOT FOR YOURSELF
------------------------------------------
- Firstly, setup your own bot at <https://discord.com/developers>
*I recommend you to watch this video for more detail at creating a discord bot: <https://youtu.be/bAnmI4mwGcs>
- Then, download this repository. (only `bot.py` and the data folder)
- Change the `token` value in `./data/config.json`.
- Run the bot in Terminal. (Make sure to run the bot in the correct directory)
*By the way, you have to install Python (recommend on the lastest version) and the Discord.py module.
