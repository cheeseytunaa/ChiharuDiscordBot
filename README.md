SETUP AND CUSTOMIZATION - BOT FOR YOURSELF (COMING SOON)
------------------------------------------
Old and trash guide:

- Firstly, setup your own bot at <https://discord.com/developers>

*I recommend you to watch this video for more detail at creating a discord bot: <https://youtu.be/bAnmI4mwGcs>
- Then, download this repository. (only `bot.py` and the data folder)
- Change the `token` value in `./data/config.json`.
- Run the bot in Terminal. (Make sure to run the bot in the correct directory)

*By the way, you have to install Python (recommend on the lastest version) and the Discord.py module.
